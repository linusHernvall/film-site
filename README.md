# Netflax

This is a school project where we would create a website similar to Netflix where you can choose and search among various available films. However, for natural reasons, the films do not need to be able to be played. Instead, you should be able to see a summary and some other information.

The goal of the project was to practice git, github and create a good workflow. The project also includes unit and integration tests.

We used React and Typescript and used MUI as the styling library. The testing was done with Vitest and React testing library.
